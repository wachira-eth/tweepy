To automatically send messages using the Twitter API, you will need to use the Twitter API's direct message endpoint. This endpoint allows you to send direct messages to a specific user.

To use the direct message endpoint, you will need to first create a Twitter developer account and create a new application. Once you have created an application, you will be given a set of API keys that you can use to authenticate your requests.

Once you have your API keys, you can use a programming language such as Python to write a script that will send the direct message. You will need to use the Twitter API library for the programming language you are using, and use the direct message endpoint with the appropriate parameters, such as the user's screen name or user ID, and the message text.

Here is an example of how you might use Python and the Twitter API library to send a direct message to a user:


import tweepy

# Authenticate using your API keys""
auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(consumer_key="", consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Send the direct message
api.send_direct_message(screen_name='username', text='Hello!')
It's important to take into consideration that there are some rules and guidelines that you need to follow when using Twitter API, you can read more about them in the official documentation.
